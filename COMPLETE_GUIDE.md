## 🎨 Customization Guide

### 1. **Edit Company Content**

All content is in ONE FILE: `lib/data/company-data.ts`

```typescript
// Company info, services, subsidiaries, blog posts, etc.
export const companyInfo = { ... }
export const services = [ ... ]
export const subsidiaries = [ ... ]
export const blogPosts = [ ... ]
```

### 2. **Change Theme Colors**

The site uses **RED** as the primary color. To change:
- Search for `red-600`, `red-700`, `red-500` in components
- Update the theme object in `company-data.ts`

### 3. **Add Images**

Create `public/images/` folder and add:
- `hero-bg.jpg` - Hero background
- Service images: `farming.jpg`, `carwash.jpg`, `restaurant.jpg`, `bricks.jpg`
- Subsidiary images: `cabal-villa.jpg`, `msta-holdings.jpg`, `lumveleni.jpg`, `agri-nema.jpg`
- Blog images: `blog-agriculture.jpg`, `blog-hospitality.jpg`, `blog-construction.jpg`

If port 3000 is busy:
```bash
npm run dev -- -p 3001
```

### Images Not Showing
- Make sure images are in `public/images/`
- Check filenames match exactly
- Try hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
